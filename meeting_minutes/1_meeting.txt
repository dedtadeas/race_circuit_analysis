Hi!

Lets discuss the steps for race circuits analysis and potential usecase and its evolution. 



I have started working on DE, IT, ES and FR circuits. So far my workflow is as follows with approximate hour estimate per circuit:



1. Download OpenStreet map layer and extract tribunes, track and other useful polygons, lines or points. (1,5 h)

By other "useful polygons and lines", I mean e.g. names of curves, start/finish or other names which will be part of the map data. I am not planning to copy all information. It should be minimal set, which will facilitate orientation on the circuit.  

2. Getting reference pictures or text from the web. Adjusting the polygons and info in the map. (1,5 h)

Adding newly build tribunes, places with standing spectators, civil buildings in close proximity to circuit.

3. Checking 2 or 3 race videos on YouTube and adjusting . (0,5 - 1 h)

4. Contact race circuit (via email) to further check potential places with spectators + review of our map. (0,5 h)

I will come up with solution to not mention V2AIR and leave it completely uninvolved. 

5. Export layers to geojson/kml, web development (0,5 h)

6. Incorporating feedbacks from your side (0,5 h)



Output: geojson/kml files + references, static website,

 

I am now finishing several circuits and first version of the static webpage. I will send info tomorrow (Tuesday)



Meeting topics:

1. Webpage usecase and features

2. Review of finished circuits

3. Approve workflow and hour estimate

4. Deadlines (10 circuits until end of September, top priority circuits until 11.10., ... ) 



Thank you!
